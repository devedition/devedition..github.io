About
</h2>
<p>
With an open mind and a curious mindset I have always been interrested in trying new things and experiment.
This site was originaly created as a way to share information, experiences and interrests. In doing so I will hopefully set someone on the path of trying new things and sharing that knowledge with others.

One of my favourite quotes is from Patrick Rothfuss, “The desire for knowledge shapes a man”, I believe that all knowledge is good even though it might not be related to your current career. Knowledge and information in general expands the way you aproach problems and challenges and helps you think outside the box.
